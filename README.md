# Isabella's Portfolio Website 
Hi welcome to my portfolio website repository. I am currently working on updating the portfolio and blog page. I made this website to learn more about CSS, HTML, bootstrap and Javascript. If you want to learn more about me head over to the about page. 

# Overview 

This is my personal portfolio website. If you want to check it out head to https://ibertagnolli.github.io/ . I started this project with minimum knowledge of web developement. I've improved a bit but I sitll have a lot to learn. I would love to transfer this static website to react and learn more about interactive elements with Javascript as a future add on to this project.
